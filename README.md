# A journey with Richard Stallman

A script to dynamically change your **wallpaper** with a travel photo by **Richard Stallman**.
All given time intervals (by default 15 minutes), a randomly selected photo is selected from [these](https://www.stallman.org/photos/rms-working/index.html).

To change the time between changes of each **wallpaper**, just change the value of `sleep_duration` in the [config.conf](https://github.com/Tim-ats-d/A-journey-with-rms/blob/master/config.conf) file.
Dont' forget to render your `main.py` executable before launch it (`chmod u+x main.py`).
