# A journey with Richard Stallman

A script to dynamically change your wallpaper with a travel photo by Richard Stallman.
All given time intervals (by default 15 minutes), a randomly selected photo is selected from [these](https://www.stallman.org/photos/rms-working/index.html).

To change the time between changes of each wallpaper, just change the value of `sleep_duration` in the [config.conf](https://github.com/Tim-ats-d/A-journey-with-rms/blob/master/config.conf) file.
